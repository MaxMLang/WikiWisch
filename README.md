Imagine doomscrolling, but useful. I love reading Wikipedia articles so I built this.

**WikiScroll** is basically TikTok for Wikipedia, an endless feed of random articles you never knew you needed. No ads, no algorithms trying to sell you stuff, just pure knowledge.

## Why?

Wikipedia has millions of articles about things I've never even heard of, ancient battles, obscure animals, weird historical events. This app just... serves them up. Scroll, learn something new, repeat.

## Run it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it. No accounts, no backend, no BS. Your bookmarks and preferences live in your browser's localStorage.

## Stack

- React + Vite (fast)
- Tailwind (pretty)
- TanStack Query (smooth data fetching)
- Wikipedia REST API (the good stuff)
