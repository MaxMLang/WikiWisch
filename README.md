## What is this

I spend way too much time on Wikipedia rabbit holes. So I made an app that just feeds me random articles. That's it. Scroll, read, bookmark the good ones.

No login, no tracking. Bookmarks stay in your browser.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Built with

React, Vite, Tailwind, TanStack Query, Wikipedia API
